**Alphabet ordering**<br>
A string is called good if all its characters form a monotonous sequence (non-increasing or non-decreasing). <br>
You are given a string S consisting of lower case english alphabets.Determine the minimum numbers of contiguos substring in which S must be broken such that each substring is good.<br>
**NOTE** :A sustring is a contihuous sequence of characters in a string.<br>
**INPUT FORMAT** <br>
The first and only line contains string S.<br>
**OUTPUT FORMAT** <br>
Print an interger denoting the required answer.<br>
**Sample Input 1** <br>
abcdcba <br>
**Sample output 1**<br>
2 <br>
**Explanation**  <br>
S can be partitioned into 'abc' and 'dcba'.Here,the first one is non-decreasing and the second one is non-increaing .<br>
**Sample Input 2**<br>

**Sample output2**<br>
3<br>
**Sample Input 3** <br>
hheaadbdgdggd                                            
**Sample output 3** <br>
